# Phase1_project

### Project Overview

This project aims to provide insight into the world of aviation for a company looking to venture into the field as a way to expand its portfolio.

### Tools.

- Github - Creating a repository.
- Git Bash - Accessing and pushing changes to the repository.
- Jupyter notebook - Doing the data analysis.
- Microsoft Powerpoint - Creating a presentation.

### Data cleaning and preparation.

I performed the following tasks in the data preparation phase:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Dealing with missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis.

EDA involved exploring the aviation data to answer the following key questions:

- What are the safest and riskiest aircraft?
- Which phase has the highest number of incidents?
- What is the trend of rate of fatalities with time?

### Recommendations.

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following:
- Aircraft Purchase:
 Prioritize the top 5 safest aircraft models and avoid the top 5 riskiest 
ones.

- Focus on risky phases:
 Implement enhanced safety protocols during the landing and takeoff 
phases of flight.

- Purpose of flight:
Avoid venturing into risky ones such as personal flights and start with 
less risky ones such as Business and public aircraft purposes.
